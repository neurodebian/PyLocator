Description:  Localization of EEG-electrodes from MRI-volumes

 PyLocator is a little program for localizing EEG electrodes from MR-images. It uses VTK to show a neat GUI for marking electrode locations in 3d-space. It is based on previous work by John D. Hunter and Michael Castell as part of pbrain, now maintained by Eli Albert. PyLocator works as a stand-alone program without any dependencies from pbrain.

 This package provides the documentation in HTML format.
 NiBabel provides read and write access to some common medical and
 neuroimaging file formats, including: ANALYZE (plain, SPM99, SPM2), GIFTI,
 NIfTI1, MINC, as well as PAR/REC. The various image format classes give full
 or selective access to header (meta) information and access to the image data
 is made available via NumPy arrays.  NiBabel is the successor of PyNIfTI.
 .
 This package also provides a commandline tool for conversion of PAR/REC to
 NIfTI images.
